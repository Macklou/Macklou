## 👩🏾‍💻 Currently Working On..

### The AI Women Safety App 
I am currently working on a safety app for women. It is for women who are experiencing stalking harassment whether outside work or within. It will enable them to keep a record of instances that have made them feel uncomfortable like a diary, they can also add photos of anything. there will be a resources sections with information on how they can reach support. There will also be a personal safety section. However the main purpose of the app will be to record with time, date, location, instance etc of any harassment or stalking so that the user has a record they can then download to a PDF to take to any authorities.

The application in version 1 is being deployed in AWS in an event driven architecture leveraging the following AWS Services:
- Lambda
    - The node.js backend runs on Lambda when invoked. 
- API Gateway
    - A public api created in API Gateway connects the application frontend and the backend 
- S3
    - The React frontend is served to users via a S3 bucket with static website hosting enabled. 

Subsequent versions of this application will include increased functionality, login and storage capabilities as well as improved hosting architecture.

The application and infrastructure repositories for this project are currently private but happy to answer questions if you have any 😊.
